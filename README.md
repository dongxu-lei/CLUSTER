# CLUSTER (Characterising Latent User Structure Through Evidence Refinement)

This repository provides key codes for constructing our model for predicting user transfer amid industrial resource variations. Two versions of CLUSTER are implemented, namely Na√Øve CLUSTER and Complete CLUSTER. Also, the code for generating the simulated dataset is contained in Simulation.py.
